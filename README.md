#File-Structures
This contains files and report of my mini project based on "Text File Compression Using LZW Algorithm"


# ABSTRACT



The Text File Compression is the data Compression Method in which the logical size of the file is reduced to Save disk Space For easier and Faster Transmission Over a Network. It Enables the Creation of a one or more files the Same data at a Size Substantially Smaller than Orginal file.

File Compression Method Using LZW(Lempel-Ziv-Welch) Algorithm.
This Algorithm is Typically used In GIF and Optionally in POF and TIFF. The Algorithm is Simple to Implement and has the Potential for very high Throughput in Hardware Implementation.
LZW Compression Works by Reading a Sequence of Symbols into Strings  and Converting Strings into Codes.Because the Codes take up Less Space than the Strings they Replace We Get Compression.

The Text-File Compression Typically Works  by Finding Similar Strings within a Text File and Replacing Those Strings with a Temporary Binary Representation to make overall Filesize Smaller.
It Can be Implemented Through the idea of the Compression Algorithms as the input data is being processed,a Dictionary keeps a Correspondence between the longest encountred words and Lists of Code Values.
 
This project has been created using Eclipse, with the platform WINDOWS. The project title-“Text File Compression” talks about how we Compress the Given File and data accepted from the USER Interface(UI) and also use it to retrieve	Information.

# REQUIREMENTS
JDK - Java Development Kit.

Any Text editors (IDE preferred - Eclipse,Net-beans etc.)

Any Windows/Mac/Linux distribution

# INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE CODES

1)Clone or download the zip file.

2)Unzip the downloaded file.

3)open the folder and open the code in any of your preferred editor or an IDE.

4)Save the code and run In UI Editor the.

5)You will be displayed with the menu choice of various options.The operations act upon the record file.

6)Choose the option of your choice to be executed.

7)Check the lzw files which are generated in the respective folder after execution.
